                <div>
                    This is a simple web-based xiangqi game that I created with JavaScript, 
                    HTML and CSS. Xiangqi is a traditional Chinese board game that is similar 
                    to chess, but with some unique rules and pieces. You can play this game against 
                    a friend on the same device, the function of against a basic AI opponent is developing.
